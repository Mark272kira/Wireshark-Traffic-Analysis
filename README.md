# 🚀 Task 5 – Wireshark Network Traffic Capture & Analysis

## 📌 Objective
To capture live network traffic using **Wireshark**, identify at least 3 protocols, and analyze how they function in a real network environment.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Wireshark** – For packet capturing and filtering
- **Windows 10** – Host machine used for network generation
- **GitHub** – To document and submit the task

## 📁 Files Included
| File Name        | Description                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `Mahin.pcap`     | Raw network traffic capture file                |
| `summary_report.md` | Analysis of protocols and sample packets     |
| `Protocol.txt` | Raw notes of extracted protocol packet details |

---

## 🔍 Protocols Observed

- **DNS** – Resolves domain names to IPs (e.g., `update.googleapis.com`)
- **UDP** – Lightweight transport protocol used for DNS queries

Sample queries included:
- DNS AAAA query to `update.googleapis.com`
- UDP A query to `play.google.com`

---

## 📘 Summary
This task helped me develop hands-on skills in:
- Capturing real-time packets
- Using Wireshark filters
- Analyzing DNS and UDP protocol traffic
- Understanding how applications initiate network communication

---

## 📎 How to Run
1. Open `Mahin.pcap` in Wireshark.
2. Apply filters like `dns`, `udp`, or inspect manually.
3. Review captured packet info and match with the report.

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcome
- Improved protocol visibility using Wireshark
- Understood structure and purpose of DNS and UDP packets
- Gained foundational knowledge in network traffic analysis
